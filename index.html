  <h3>Nationality and Culture</h3>
  <p>Egyptian, more specifically, Coptic Orthodox.</p>
  <h3>Interesting fact</h3>
  <p>Both my parents being purely Coptic, this means I am a direct descendant from the pharaohs of ancient Egypt.</p>

<div id="Interest in IT" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
  <p>growing up, I have always been fascinated in IT, other than messing around with computers throughout my life, a Cert III in Information Digital media and Technology is the only IT experience and qualification I have.</p>
   <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
   <p>I chose to come to RMIT as it offers great opportunities.</p>
   <h3>Study expectations</h3>
   <p>During my studies, I expect to learn the prerequisites for on campus learning.</p>

<div id="Ideal Job" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
  <p>In the future, I would like to work as a Cyber Security Specialist</p>
  <h3>Link of Job</h3>

   <p> Cybersecurity specialists monitor, detect, analyze, and respond to security events. They protect systems from cybersecurity risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Protection of civilians is very appealing to me, especially in the IT industry as that is what I am most comfortable with.</p>
   
<h3>More:</h3>

<p>In order to successfully pursue a career as a cyber security specialist, strong IT skills and knowledge including hardware, software and networks is required. You must have a forensic approach to challenges and the ability to use logic and reasoning to identify the strengths and weaknesses of an IT system.</p>

<p>I feel I already have strong hardware knowledge and a forensic approach to challenges.</p>

<p>My plan for obtaining my missing skills is my completing a Cyber Security degree, this should teach me everything that is required.</p>

  <h3>Profile</h3>
<p>After completing the <a href="http://www.16personalities.com/">http://www.16personalities.com/</a> personality test, I received the following results:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>76% extraverted, 24% introverted</li>
    <li>73% intuitive, 27% observant</li>
    <li>21% thinking, 79% feeling</li>
    <li>40% judging, 60% prospecting</li>
    <li>40% assertive, 60% Turbulent</li>
<p>These results help me come to a analytical conclusion which supports my previously unsupported hypothesis of being a great addition to a collaborative team. When forming a team, the results suggest that my role should be interaction based since I have a very high extraverted score, this may mean doing a lot of the talking whether that is through suggestions or helping others understand each other with my input.</p>

<div id="Project Ideas" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Project Ideas</h3>
  <p>Many challenges came along with the recent COVID-19 outbreak. My project idea utilizes IT to aid just one of these challenges &ndash; Social Distancing. There have been almost 1000 deaths in Australia due to COVID that could have very well been avoided in the case that social distancing was practiced efficiently. Since the pandemic cases are on a decrease, the public are actively taking it less seriously every day; even though towards the potential end of a pandemic is when the public should be the strictest on our social distancing rules and limitations. My potential enforcement of social distancing that would ideally be utilised by the government is a development of an application that tracks and displays the populations&rsquo; live location in a user friendly manner that would allow the public to avoid crowded areas and aid law enforcement in responding to social distancing breaches.</p>

<p>This application will be very important and beneficial, it will certainly save lives and does not have to be exclusive to the current pandemic. It may even be sold to the government and incorporated into government apps. The approach of creating an app rather than selling hardware is much more convenient, enforceable and cheaper. Once the pandemic is over, I recommend this civilian to enforcement tracking remains; it can be used for things like speed enforcement or even tracking hostages. The program will be beneficial in avoiding emergencies and enhancing the response when there is an emergency.</p>

<p>The methodology that should ideally be utilised to make this idea a reality is to create a program using Python, Node. js, Go, and Java. The mechanism will be similar to most car apps like uber, waze etc&#8230; The main challenges are implementation and enforcement. In order to tackle the implementation challenge, narrowing the possibilities down will be the first step to take. This app can either be used to show the user where they should and shouldn&rsquo;t be, used as a substitute to the service NSW check in app or both. The other challenge is getting everybody to download it, and even if successful, not everybody has full time access to a mobile device, especially with cellular service. The solution to this is purely mathematical; before the launch of the app, statistical surveys and experimentation must be taken in order to create formulas relating to averages in order to accurately predict the population of a particular area based off the received mobile signals. During the first few months of launch, user feedback will be very important as there is a predicted mass privacy concern from the public and in order to go forward with the project, we must cater to what the majority are comfortable with and make adjustments accordingly. Appealability is a big factor and for that reason the interface will be almost as If it is a social media platform, users will be able to add each other, share locations, set privacy settings and even send messages to each other. Additional features can and will be added upon user feedback.</p>

<p>A team of programmers will be required with the adequate combined or individual skills to efficiently operate and have strong creativity and confidence in Python, Node. js, Go, and Java. No special hardware will be required. The feasibility of finding these skills in a group of new university students is very low and for that reason will be a costly endeavor to create a prototype and effectively launch. For this reason, the goal of the company is for it to be funded with cash flow (the money that is made is put back in) with the ultimate goal of generating enough publicity to reach out to the government.</p>

<p>If the project is successful, many lives will most certainly be saved, many people will be much more comfortable going out and crime rates should effectively drop. This is an enormous potentially global impact from such a simple development.</p>
